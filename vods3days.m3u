[plugins.twitch][info] Low latency streaming (HLS live edge: 1)
[plugins.twitch][info] This is not a low latency stream
[warnings][streamlinkwarning] The --player argument has been changed and now only takes player path values:
  Player paths must not be wrapped in additional quotation marks
  and custom player arguments need to be set via --player-args.
  This is most likely caused by using an old config file from an ealier Streamlink version.
  Please see the migration guides in Streamlink's documentation:
